You and me are going to build a most efficient dynamic macro. 
I will give you an outline first. 
	I create a manual report  which I call the master report in Excel. From the data in the master report, with 
	filtering the data as well as removing the fields, we get the data for the other reports. There are totally 
	7 reports that are derived from the master report data. 

Here's the detailed instruction.
1st step. 
	Read the format in which the POD date is in. 
To filter the overall data ask for the date range -  from date and well as the to date (also display the format 
in which the date has to be included for the filter to work. Also ask if the blanks has to be included or not. 
Now extract the data within the filter range and create a new sheet with the sheet name - "Master"

note: when you extract the data from the master sheet, make sure after each data extraction, the original master
sheet remains unaltered for the next data extraction.
before bifercation of the data into the 7 reports, make sure the that the columns are good. to do this just check 
the columns - Sales Loc, Country, Team, Section, Group if there are any values with N/A or Blanks or unassigned.
If there are any such values, create a message box which will display the column name and terminate the macro
without any changes to the master sheet

step 2: 
	To the "Master" sheet, apply the following filters - (Sales Loc: UAE) / (Country: UAE) / (Team: Select all the data 
except 'Amir Hossien Khaksar') 
With the filtered data, create a new sheet with the name - "Samer"
	Now in the 'Samer' sheet, remove the columns with the following headers - Costed, Unit Cost, GP, GP %, Workweek, 
Total Item Cost, GP Value, GP %, 
	Now keep the remaining data as it is in the 'Samer' sheet.

Step 3:
From the "Master" sheet, apply the following filters - (Sales Loc: UAE) / (Country: UAE) / (Team: Prinu)  
whatever the resultant data is there after applying the filters, create a new sheet with the name - "Prinu"
Now in the 'Prinu' sheet, remove the columns with the following headers - Costed, Unit Cost, GP, GP %, Workweek, 
Total Item Cost, GP Value, GP %.
	Now keep the remaining data as it is in the 'Prinu' sheet.

Step 4:
	To the "Master" sheet, apply the following filters - (Team: Ramy & Heba) / (Section: HHH)
With the filtered data, create a new sheet with the name - "Ramy"
	Now in the 'Ramy' sheet, remove the columns with the following headers - Costed, Unit Cost, GP, GP %, Workweek, 
Total Item Cost, GP Value, GP %.
	Now keep the remaining data as it is in the 'Ramy' sheet.		

Step 5:
	To the "Master" sheet, apply the following filters - (Team: Amir Hossien Khaksar)	
With the filtered data, create a new sheet with the name - "Amir"
	Now in the 'Amir' sheet, remove the columns with the following headers - Costed, Unit Cost, GP, GP %, Workweek, 
Total Item Cost, GP Value, GP %.
	Now keep the remaining data as it is in the 'Amir' sheet.

Step 6:
	To the "Master" sheet, apply the following filters - (Sales Loc: UAE) / (Country: UAE) / 
	(Group: Online) / (Section: Select all data except 'HHH')
With the filtered data, create a new sheet with the name - "John"
	Now in the 'John' sheet, remove the columns with the following headers - Costed, Unit Cost, GP, GP %, Workweek, 
Total Item Cost, GP Value, GP %.
	Now keep the remaining data as it is in the 'John' sheet.			

Step 7:
	To the "Master" sheet, apply the following filters - (Sales Loc: Prime)
With the filtered data, create a new sheet with the name - "Michel"

Step 8:
	To the "Master" sheet, apply the following filters - (Sales Loc: Oman)			
With the filtered data, create a new sheet with the name - "Rabih"
 Now in the 'Rabih' sheet, remove the columns with the following headers - Costed, Unit Cost, GP, GP %, Workweek, 
Total Item Cost, GP Value, GP %.
	Now keep the remaining data as it is in the 'Rabih' sheet.
